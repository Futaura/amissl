 NOTES FOR THE OPENVMS PLATFORM
 ==============================

 Requirement details
 -------------------

 In addition to the requirements listed in INSTALL, these are required
 as well:

  * At least ODS-5 disk organization for source and build.
    Installation can be done on any existing disk organization.


 About ANSI C compiler
 ---------------------

 An ANSI C compiled is needed among other things.  This means that VAX C
 is not and will not be supported.

 We have only tested with DEC C (a.k.a HP VMS C / VSI C), compiling with
 a different ANSI C compiler may require some work.


 Checking the distribution
 -------------------------

 There have been reports of places where the distribution didn't quite
 get through, for example if you've copied the tree from a NFS-mounted
 Unix mount point.

 The easiest way to check if everything got through as it should is to
 check for one of the following files:

   [.crypto]opensslconf^.h.in

 The best way to get a correct distribution is to download the gzipped
 tar file from ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/, use GZIP -d to uncompress
 it and VMSTAR to unpack the resulting tar file.

 Gzip and VMSTAR are available here:

 Should you need it, you can find UnZip for VMS here:
