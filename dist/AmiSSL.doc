$VER: AmiSSL.doc 3.6 (25.2.2006)

General
-------

AmiSSL is a shared library package, port of OpenSSL which is "a collaborative
effort to develop a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured, and Open Source
toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer
Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength general purpose
cryptography library".

AmiSSL contains three major components: the libraries, the certificate files
and a port of the OpenSSL tool.

Libraries
---------

The main library is amisslmaster.library which acts as a proxy which opens
the appropriate AmiSSL library for the programs using AmiSSL. It is possible
to have different AmiSSL versions installed at the same time since
amisslmaster.library will make sure that the correct libraries are opened.
However, since a certain version of amisslmaster.library cannot know about
the future releases of AmiSSL, it is important that the latest version of
amisslmaster.library is installed.

The amisslmaster.library was introduced with AmiSSL v2, but since none of
AmiSSL v1 file names collide with later AmiSSL releases, they can coexist on
the same system with the later versions.

The rest of the libraries are found inside amissl directory. With the exception
of AmiSSL v1 libraries there, none of them should be opened directly, but
through amisslmaster.library. The technical details on this can be found in
AmiSSL SDK documentation.

The previous versions of libraries in amissl directory should be kept there
when a new version of AmiSSL is released since they may still be used. For
example, IBrowse v2.3 uses AmiSSL v2 libraries through amisslmaster.library.
These libraries are named amissl/amissl_v2.library,
amissl/blowfish_v2.library etc and are based on OpenSSL 0.9.6g. The first
release of AmiSSL v3 is based on OpenSSL 0.9.7g, latest available at the
time. It includes amissl/amissl_v097g.library (all other libraries like
blowfish, cast etc are now included in it and the name reflects the OpenSSL
version number). Since OpenSSL 0.9.6g and 0.9.7g have incompatible API's and
public structures, when IBrowse v2.3 tries to open AmiSSL through
amisslmaster.library v3, amisslmaster.library will honor its request and and
open AmiSSL v2 libraries even though AmiSSL v3 library is available.

Another example: suppose that a program is compiled for OpenSSL 0.9.7g API.
When it asks amisslmaster.library to open AmiSSL with that API,
amisslmaster.library will open amissl/amissl_097g.library. If a bugfix
version of OpenSSL 0.9.7g called 0.9.7h with compatible API is released,
AmiSSL could be updated to include amissl/amissl_097h.library. The
amisslmaster.library would then open amissl/amissl_097h.library on behalf of
the program even though it was compiled for and asked for version 0.9.7g. The
program would thus benefit from the fixed version without recompilation.

Even though amissl/amissl_v097g.library includes IDEA and RC5 ciphers and
MDC2 message digest, AmiSSL will make them unavailable depending on the
country selected in the Locale settings (for example, none of IDEA, RC5 and
MDC2 are available in the USA due to licensing issues). When downloading
AmiSSL, you should have been presented with a license which specifies that
you agree to select the correct country in the Locale settings. AmiSSL
authors take no responsibility for potential legal problems if the incorrect
country is selected.

Certificates
------------

AmiSSL includes the certificate files which are installed into
AmiSSL:certs directory (Note: the AmiSSL: assign must exist - it is usually
added to user-startup by the install script).

Each AmiSSL version comes with full set of certificates and has those that
have expired removed. If you had some earlier versions of AmiSSL installed,
it is suggested that the old AmiSSL:certs directory is replaced with the
certs directory from the latest AmiSSL archive. If you added some
certificates to the AmiSSL:certs directory, you should back them up and, if
they haven't expired, copy them back after installing the latest AmiSSL certs
directory.

Note: "OpenSSL x509 -in cert_file_name -enddate -noout" will output the
certificate expiration date.

Besides AmiSSL:certs directory, the usercerts and private directories can be
found inside AmiSSL: These are not used by AmiSSL, they are meant to be used
by the application software.

The OpenSSL tool
----------------

A port of the OpenSSL tool is also included. It is a "command line tool for
using the various cryptography functions of OpenSSL's crypto library from the
shell". The documentation for the OpenSSL tool is included in the archive.
